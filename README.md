# WebDevelopmentNotes

5. Browsing the Web

When we type in a URL, our computer asks our ISP:

1. Who is "google.com"?

The ISP then asks the DNS (a phone book of domains) and sends back an IP address.

The computer then connects to the IP address and google sends back HTML, CSS, and JS files.

So, if you have the IP address, you can just type the ip address into your browser to access a website.

TRY: 172.217.7.23
